# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created as a part of the prework required to enter the Skills Bootcamp. 

It required a completion of a series of tasks, including installation of relevant software onto my machine, creating GitHub account etc. 

I have learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript which allowed me to build this website.
